**Introduction**

Microsoft Azure is Microsoft's public cloud platform for customers. Customers can use the platform in many different ways. For example, customers can use Microsoft Azure to build a Web application that runs and stores their data in a Microsoft data center. Microsoft Azure can also be used to create virtual machines for development and testing, and the Microsoft Azure platform offers a wide range of services that help users use on demand, reduce cost of ownership, increase delivery speed, and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their IT spending.

**Characteristic introduction**

Reliability: Microsoft Azure's platform design completely eliminates single points of failure and provides enterprise-grade service level agreements (SLA).  It can easily realize remote multi-point backup and bring foolproof disaster prevention backup capabilities, allowing users to focus on developing and running applications instead of worrying about infrastructure.  Since its official commercial launch in February 2010, Microsoft Azure has become the choice of a large number of multinational companies such as Boeing and BMW.

Flexibility: Microsoft Azure provides both Windows and Linux virtual machines and supports a large number of open source tools such as PHP, Node.js, and Python.  It provides great flexibility and can instantly deploy any number of virtual machines and call unlimited storage space according to actual needs.  Microsoft Azure has flexible pricing and supports pay-per-use, helping users bring new services online at the lowest cost and then expand as needed.

Business Value: Microsoft Azure provides the industry's top cloud computing technology, and its three key indicators of cloud storage technology performance, scalability and stability have come out on top in Nasuni's authoritative tests.  Microsoft Azure can be mixed with an enterprise's existing on-premises IT infrastructure to provide hybrid cloud solutions from on-premises private cloud to public cloud for storage, management, virtualization, identity, and development.

 - Application Gateway: Provides application-level load balancing, SSL termination, and web application firewall capabilities.

**Azure security**

Azure's security is one of the core aspects of its design, providing multiple measures and capabilities to protect users' data and applications. Here are some of Azure's security measures and features:

1. Authentication and Access Control: Azure provides multiple authentication and access control mechanisms, including Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Multi-factor Authentication (MFA), Role Based Access Control (RBAC), and more. These mechanisms help users manage access rights for users and groups and ensure that only authorized users can access their resources.

2. Data encryption: Azure provides data encryption functions, including data transmission encryption and data static encryption. Data transmission encryption protects the security of data during transmission by using SSL/TLS protocols. Static data encryption Uses the encryption function of the Azure storage service to encrypt data during storage to protect data security in static state.

3. Threat Detection and Defense: Azure provides advanced threat detection capabilities to analyze and detect potential security threats through the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. Azure Security Center is a centralized security management and threat defense platform that helps users monitor and protect their Azure resources.

4. Security Audit and Compliance: Azure provides security audit and compliance capabilities that help users track and log security activities and events for their resources. Azure Security Center also provides compliance assessments and recommendations to help users meet industry standards and regulatory requirements.

5. Network Security: Azure provides network security features, including Virtual Network (VNet) and Network Security Group (NSG). VNet can isolate Azure resources in a virtual network and control network access through subnets and network security groups. The NSG can define inbound and outbound rules for network traffic to protect resources from unauthorized access.

In summary, Azure security measures and features cover identity authentication, access control, data encryption, threat detection and defense, security audit and compliance, network security, and more to help users protect their data and applications
